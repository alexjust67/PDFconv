instruction on an SE aeroplane including: 
(i) pre-flight operations, mass and balance determination, aeroplane inspection and 
servicing; 
(ii) aerodrome and traffic pattern operations, collision avoidance and precautions; 
(iii) control of the aeroplane by external visual references; 
(iv) normal take-offs and landings; 
(v) the basic UPRT exercises as specified in point (b) of AMC2 to Appendix 3; AMC1 to 
Appendix 5;
(vi) simulated engine failure. 
(2) Phase 2: 
Exercises up to the first solo cross-country flight comprise a total of at least 10 hours of 
dual flight instruction and at least 10 hours solo flight including: 
(i) maximum performance (short field and obstacleclearance) takeoffs and short-field 
landings; 
(ii)flight by reference solely to instruments, including the completion of a 180 ° turn; 
(iii) dual cross-country flying using external visual references, DR and radio navigation 
aids, diversion procedures;
(iv) aerodrome and traffic pattern operations at different aerodromes; 
(v) crosswind take-offs and landings; 
(vi) abnormal and emergency procedures and manoeuvres, including simulated 
aeroplane equipment malfunctions; 
(vii) operations to, from and transiting controlled aerodromes, compliance with ATS 
procedures, R/T procedures and phraseology; 
(viii) knowledge of meteorological briefing arrangements, evaluation of weather 
conditions for flight and use of AIS. 
(3) Phase 3:
Exercises up to the VFR navigation progress test comprise a total of at least 5 hours of 
dual instruction and at least 40 hours as PIC. 
The dual instruction and testing up to the VFR navigation progress test should comprise: 
(i) repetition of exercises of phases 1 and 2; 
(ii)stocatraining; 
(iii) dual night flightinstruction. 
(4) Phase 4: 
Exercises up to the instrument rating skill test comprise:
(i) at least 55 hours instrument flight, which maycontain up to 25 hours of instrument 
ground time in an FNPT I or up to 40 hours in an FNPT II or FFS which should be 
conducted by an FI or an authorised SFI; 
(ii) 20 hours instrument time flown as SPIC; 
(iii) pre-flight procedures for IFR flights, including the use of the flight manual and 
appropriate ATS documents in the preparation of an IFR flight plan; 
(iv) procedures and manoeuvres for IFR operation under normal, abnormal and 
emergency conditions covering at least:
(A) transition from visual to instrument flight on take-off; 
(B) SIDs and arrivals;
(C) en-route IFR procedures;
(D) holding procedures; 
(E) instrument approaches to specified minima; 
(F) missed approach procedures; 
(G) landings from instrument approaches, including circling;
(v) in-flight manoeuvres and specific flight characteristicsand the basic UPRT exercises 
as specified in Sections A, B, C and D of Table 2 in point (b) of AMC2 to Appendix 3; 
AMC1 to Appendix 5;
(vi) operation of an ME aeroplane in the exercises of (iv), including operation of the 
aeroplane solely by reference to instruments with one engine simulated 
inoperative, and engine shut-down and restart (the latter training should be 
conducted at a safe altitudeunless carried out in an FSTD);
(vii) after completion of instrument training that is equivalent to the basic instrument 
flight module set out in AMC2 to Appendix 6, take-offs and landings as PIC at night.
(5) Phase 5: Advanced UPRT in accordance with point FCL.745.A;
(6) Phase 6:
(i) instruction and testing in MCC comprising the relevant training requirements; 
(ii) if a type rating for single-pilot aeroplanes in multi-pilot operations, or multi-pilot 
aeroplanes is not required on completion of this phase, the applicant should be 
issued with a certificate of course completion for MCC training.
B. ATP modular theoretical knowledge course: aeroplanes 
(a) The aim of this course is to train pilots who have not received the theoretical knowledge 
instruction during an integrated course to the level of theoretical knowledge required for the 
ATPL. 
(b) An approved course may contain in suitable proportions: 
(1) classroom work;
(2) lessons; 
(3) tutorials; 
(4) demonstrations, including those supported by demonstration equipment; 
(5) exercises carried out as groups or individuals and based on pre-flight and en-route 
planning, communications, presentations and projects; 
(6) exercises that use demonstration equipment or training devices; 
(7) directed study including workbook exercises or assignments; 
(8) aerodrome or aviation industry field trips; 
(9) computer-based training and e-learning elements; 
(10) progress tests, Area 100 KSA assessments and mental maths test(s); and
(11) other training methods, media and tools approved by the competent authority.
Approved distance-learning (correspondence) courses may also be offered as part of the course. 
The minimum amount of classroom instruction, as required by ORA.ATO.305, may include all of 
the above except item (b)(9).
(c) The ATP modular course should be completed within18 months. This period may be extended 
where additional training is provided by the ATO. The flight instruction and skill test need to be 
completed within the period of validity of the pass in the theoretical examinations. 
C. CPL/IR integrated course: aeroplanes 
(a) The CPL/IR integrated course should last between 9 and 30 months. This period may be 
extended where additional flying training or ground instruction is provided by the ATO. 
CREDITING 
(b) Credit for previous experience given to an applicant who already holds a PPL should be entered stocalicence and with the approval of the competent authority, an ATO may designate certain dual 
exercises to be flown in a helicopter or a TMG up to a maximum of 20 hours.
