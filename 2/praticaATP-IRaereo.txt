(d) The flying instructionis divided into sixphases: 
(1) Phase 1:
Exercises up to the first solo flight comprise a total of at least 10 hours dual flight 
instruction on an SE aeroplane including: 
(i) pre-flight operations, mass and balance determination, aeroplane inspection and 
servicing; 
(ii) aerodrome and traffic pattern operations, collision avoidance and precautions; 
(iii) control of the aeroplane by external visual references; 
(iv) normal take-offs and landings; 
(v) the basic UPRT exercises as specified in point (b) of AMC2 to Appendix 3; AMC1 to 
Appendix 5;
(vi) simulated engine failure. 
(2) Phase 2: 
Exercises up to the first solo cross-country flight comprise a total of at least 10 hours of 
dual flight instruction and at least 10 hours solo flight including: 
(i) maximum performance (short field and obstacleclearance) takeoffs and short-field 
landings; 
(ii)flight by reference solely to instruments, including the completion of a 180 ° turn; 
(iii) dual cross-country flying using external visual references, DR and radio navigation 
aids, diversion procedures;
(iv) aerodrome and traffic pattern operations at different aerodromes; 
(v) crosswind take-offs and landings; 
(vi) abnormal and emergency procedures and manoeuvres, including simulated 
aeroplane equipment malfunctions; 
(vii) operations to, from and transiting controlled aerodromes, compliance with ATS 
procedures, R/T procedures and phraseology; 
(viii) knowledge of meteorological briefing arrangements, evaluation of weather 
conditions for flight and use of AIS. 
(3) Phase 3:
Exercises up to the VFR navigation progress test comprise a total of at least 5 hours of 
dual instruction and at least 40 hours as PIC. 
The dual instruction and testing up to the VFR navigation progress test should comprise: 
(i) repetition of exercises of phases 1 and 2; 
(ii) VFR navigation progress test conducted by an FI not connected with the applicant's training; 
(iii) dual night flightinstruction. 
(4) Phase 4: 
Exercises up to the instrument rating skill test comprise:
(i) at least 55 hours instrument flight, which maycontain up to 25 hours of instrument 
ground time in an FNPT I or up to 40 hours in an FNPT II or FFS which should be 
conducted by an FI or an authorised SFI; 
(ii) 20 hours instrument time flown as SPIC; 
(iii) pre-flight procedures for IFR flights, including the use of the flight manual and 
appropriate ATS documents in the preparation of an IFR flight plan; 
(iv) procedures and manoeuvres for IFR operation under normal, abnormal and 
emergency conditions covering at least:
(A) transition from visual to instrument flight on take-off; 
(B) SIDs and arrivals;
(C) en-route IFR procedures;
(D) holding procedures; 
(E) instrument approaches to specified minima; 
(F) missed approach procedures; 
(G) landings from instrument approaches, including circling;
(v) in-flight manoeuvres and specific flight characteristicsand the basic UPRT exercises 
as specified in Sections A, B, C and D of Table 2 in point (b) of AMC2 to Appendix 3; 
AMC1 to Appendix 5;
(vi) operation of an ME aeroplane in the exercises of (iv), including operation of the 
aeroplane solely by reference to instruments with one engine simulated 
inoperative, and engine shut-down and restart (the latter training should be 
conducted at a safe altitudeunless carried out in an FSTD);
(vii) after completion of instrument training that is equivalent to the basic instrument 
flight module set out in AMC2 to Appendix 6, take-offs and landings as PIC at night.
(5) Phase 5: Advanced UPRT in accordance with point FCL.745.A;
(6) Phase 6:
(i) instruction and testing in MCC comprising the relevant training requirements; 
(ii) if a type rating for single-pilot aeroplanes in multi-pilot operations, or multi-pilot 
aeroplanes is not required on completion of this phase, the applicant should be 
issued with a certificate of course completion for MCC training.
