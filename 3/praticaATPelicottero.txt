(d) The flight instruction is divided into three phases: 
(1) phase 1:
Flight exercises up to the first solo flight comprise a total of not less than 12 hours dual 
flight instruction on a helicopter, including:
(i) pre-flight operations, mass and balance determination, helicopter inspection and 
servicing; 
(ii) aerodrome and traffic pattern operations, collision avoidance and procedures; 
(iii) control of the helicopter by external visual reference; 
(iv) take-offs, landings, hovering, look-out turns and normal transitions from and to the 
hover; 
(v) emergency procedures, basic auto-rotations, simulated engine failure, ground 
resonance recovery if relevant to type. 
(2) phase 2: 
Flight exercises until general handling and day VFR navigation progress and basic  instrument flying progress check conducted by an FI not connected with the applicant's training. This phase comprises a total flight time of not less than 128hours, including 73 
hours of dual instruction flight time and including at least 5 hours VFR conversion training 
on an ME helicopter, 15 hours of solo flight and 40 hours flown as student PIC. The 
instruction and testing contain the following: 
(i) sideways and backwards flight, turns on the spot; 
(ii) incipient vortex ring recovery; 
(iii) touchdown or advanced auto-rotations, simulated engine-off landings, practice 
forced landings. Simulated equipment malfunctions and emergency procedures 
relating to malfunctions of engines, controls, electrical and hydraulic circuits; 
(iv) steep turns; 
(v) transitions, quick stops, out of wind manoeuvres, sloping ground landings and 
take-offs; 
(vi) limited power and confined area operations, including low level operations to and 
from unprepared sites; 
(vii) 10 hours flight by sole reference to basic flight instruments, including completion 
of a 180 ° turn and recovery from unusual attitudes to simulate inadvertent entry 
into cloud; 
(viii) cross-country flying by external visual reference, DR and radio navigation aids, 
diversion procedures; 
(ix) aerodrome and traffic pattern operations at different aerodromes; 
(x) operations to, from and transiting controlled aerodromes, compliance with ATS 
procedures, R/T procedures and phraseology; 
(xi) application of meteorological briefing arrangements, evaluation of weather 
conditions for flight and use of AIS; 
(xii) night flight, including take-offs and landings as PIC;
(xiii) general handling, day VFR navigation and basic instrument flying progress checks 
in accordance with Appendix 4 to Part-FCL, conducted by an FI not connected with  the applicant's training (3) phase 3: 
Instruction in MCC comprises the relevant training set out in FCL.735.H and AMC1 
FCL.735.A, FCL.735.H and FCL.735.As . 
If a type rating for MP helicopter is not required on completion of this part, the applicant 
should be provided with a certificate of course completion for MCC training.
